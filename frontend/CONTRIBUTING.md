# Guidance on how to contribute

There are two primary ways to help:
 - Using the issue tracker, and
 - Changing the code-base.


## Using the issue tracker

Use the issue tracker to suggest feature requests, report bugs, and ask questions.
This is also a great way to connect with the developers of the project as well
as others who are interested in this solution.

Use the issue tracker to find ways to contribute. Find a bug or a feature, mention in
the issue that you will take on that effort, then follow the _Changing the code-base_
guidance below.


## Changing the code-base

Generally speaking, you should fork this repository, make changes in your
own fork, and then submit a pull request. We are using a React template and the `src/content/own` directory contains the tsx pages used in this project.
