After changing any env variable starting with `REACT_APP_` or `PUBLIC_API_URL` you should run  `docker compose up -d --no-deps --build`

#### For remote servers

- You need to update every env variable starting with `PUBLIC_`.
- You must also update every env variable starting with `SMTP`.
- Open ports if necessary: make sure to open `REACT_APP_API_URL`, `PUBLIC_FRONT_URL` ports numbers by default
8080, and 3000. Same for `PUBLIC_MINIO_ENDPOINT` port 9000 if you use Minio.

### Run

```sh
docker-compose up -d
```

Now, go to http://localhost:3000 or your custom `PUBLIC_FRONT_URL`

Celebrate on how easy this was
